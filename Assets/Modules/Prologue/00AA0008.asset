  - 'Thank you for letting me give this speech on such a special occassion. '
  - I wish to start by expressing my gratitude for all friends, families and teachers
    involved.
  - It has been a long journey to get where we are today.
  - I believe that we would not be here without the help of others
  - who have always been with us since we stepped into this school.
  - It comes as a great delight to finally make it through 3 years of school.
  - 'We did not simply idle through those years, but weathered them with hard work
    and determination. '
  - And all that hard work has come to fruition, evident in the fact that we are
    all gathered in this room.
  - We have reached the gateway to a higher education where we will start the struggle
    anew.
  - I remember the story of Sisyphus who was damned to push a boulder up a hill
  - only to see it tumble down again for all eternity.
  - 'Despite this, Sisyphus learned to be content with his perpetual strife. '
  - What we can learn from Sisyphus is that even though it is our duty to endlessly
    pursue knowledge
  - We alone determine whether it comes as a burden or a great pleasure.
  - Ultimately, achievements do not matter, but what you do for society in spite
    of them.
  - I hope a very bright future for all my friends.
  - May your journey be just as promising and full of surprises as this day.
  - 'Thank you for listening to my speech. Godspeed.  '
